Hi, I’m @Carlos-Glez28

My current inteerests lie in the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science. I am a recent grad who has the want to self study different concepts and become a better programmer overall.
I am also interested in backend and slowly learning data science and the theory of machine learning. I am looking to start helping open source projects that make a difference and that will help me become a better programmer.
